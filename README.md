# Consentra - Export Entra OAuth2 Grants

PowerShell script that inventories Entra ID OAuth delegated consents, enriches them with service principal metadata, and produces both CSV and interactive HTML reports for security reviews.

## ‚ú® Features

- Queries `oauth2PermissionGrants` via Microsoft Graph and deduplicates grants per enterprise application.
- Pulls extended service principal metadata (publisher, verified publisher, service principal names, tags).
- Classifies apps as Microsoft, tenant-owned, or third party using multiple heuristics.
- Includes hidden enterprise applications by enriching the data set with the complete tenant service principal inventory.
- Highlights risky scopes (e.g., `*ReadWrite*`, `Directory.AccessAsUser.All`) and flags low-impact grants.
- Generates outputs:
  - **CSV** with raw data and metadata for spreadsheets or SIEM ingestion.
  - **HTML** dashboard with search, consent-type chips, Microsoft/third-party toggles, vendor tags, alphabetical sort toggle, and CSV export of any filtered view.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| PowerShell 7.2+ (recommended) or Windows PowerShell 5.1 | Script was tested on PowerShell 7; older hosts should enforce TLS 1.2. |
| Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK | Install with `Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser`. |
| Graph permissions | The signed-in identity must be able to consent to **Directory.Read.All** and **Application.Read.All** (admin consent recommended). |
| Internet access | Calls the Microsoft Graph `beta` and `v1.0` endpoints. |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The script auto-connects if no existing Graph context is found, but you can connect manually (see below) to control the scope consent and profile selection.

## üöÄ Setup

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
# Optional: pick needed profile (beta is default when using Invoke-MgGraphRequest)
# Select-MgProfile -Name beta
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'Directory.Read.All','Application.Read.All'
```

If `Connect-MgGraph` prompts for admin consent, ensure you sign in with an account that can grant those scopes tenant-wide.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script from the repo root (or provide the full path):

```powershell
# Export all grants
./consentra.ps1

# Filter to apps whose display name contains "ServiceNow"
./consentra.ps1 -AppNameContains "ServiceNow"
```

> üí° On Windows PowerShell run `.\consentra.ps1`; on macOS/Linux under PowerShell 7 you can use `./consentra.ps1` as shown above.

Outputs are written to the current directory:

- `OAuth2_Consent_Apps_<timestamp>.csv`
- `OAuth2_Consent_Report_<timestamp>.html`

You can open the HTML file locally in any modern browser.

## üìä HTML report overview

- **Status chips**: toggle all, critical, elevated, or low-impact apps.
- **Vendor chips**: quickly isolate Microsoft or verified third-party apps using the built-in classification.
- **Consent chips**: click on the `Admin Consent` / `User Consent` tags in a card to filter by consent type.
- **Search box**: type to filter by app display name; `‚åò/` or `Ctrl+/` focuses the search.
- **Sort button**: `Sort A‚ÜíZ` toggles between ascending and descending alphabetical order.
- **Metadata panel**: expand a card to review publisher, domains, service principal names, tags, and consent details.
- **Inline CSV export**: the `Export CSV` button downloads the currently filtered subset without re-running the script.

## üìÅ CSV schema

The CSV contains the following key columns:

- `clientName`, `clientAppId`: display name and AppId of the enterprise application.
- `status`: `pass`, `warn`, or `fail` based on scope analysis (critical `ReadWrite` scopes drive `fail`).
- `isMicrosoft`, `isThirdParty`: vendor classification flags.
- `publisher`, `publisherDomain`, `verifiedPublisherName`, `verifiedPublisherId`, `appOwnerOrgId`.
- `servicePrincipalNames`, `servicePrincipalTags`, `servicePrincipalType`.
- `adminScopes`, `userScopes`: semicolon-separated `resource:scope` pairs.
- `userCount`: distinct user count for delegated grants.
- `tags`: the same set of label chips shown in the HTML report (admin/user consent, usage counts, vendor).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Missing data**: ensure the account you use has sufficient permissions and that the tenant contains delegated OAuth grants.
- **Graph throttling**: the script batches service principal metadata requests in chunks of 20; if you hit throttling, re-run after a short delay.
- **Locale mismatches**: the HTML sorting uses invariant lowercase comparisons; display names with leading punctuation may group separately.
- **Consent errors**: if automatic `Connect-MgGraph` fails, run it manually before executing the script so you can resolve MFA or approval prompts.
